### This is a word game meant only to be played in Node-js

Both the **word.js** and **letter.js** files are constructors
where **_index.js_** depends on word.js which depends on letter.js

The user will immediately be asked to select a letter and press enter. The words that the user will be trying to guess come from a list of NBA players. The user is granted 10 incorrect guesses to reveal the player!


There are limitations to the users guess. It **must** be a letter and can only be **one** character. Otherwise, user will be prompted with an invalid guess message, and asked to guess again.
